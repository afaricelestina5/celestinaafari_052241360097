            <p>The Faculty of Applied Sciences and Technology was carved out from the then
                Faculty of Applied Sciences in October, 2016. The reason for renaming the Faculty
                was to help introduce new technology-related programmes and also to properly manage
                the existing ones in the institution.</p>
